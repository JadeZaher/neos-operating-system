# API architecture

## OAuth return origins

The production backend serves more than one frontend origin. OAuth initiation therefore carries the initiating frontend through the provider round trip in signed `state`, instead of relying on one global redirect URL.

Only origins listed in `CORS_ORIGINS` or `FRONTEND_URL` may be encoded or accepted. The signed state must also match the short-lived, HttpOnly transaction cookie set for the initiating browser; callbacks consume that cookie and reject missing or mismatched state before token exchange.

Keep the provider callback itself on `OAUTH_REDIRECT_BASE`; changing the consumer origin must not require additional provider callback registrations or permit an open redirect.

## Agreement consent and participation gates

Agreement consent is a personal, version-bound attestation, never a free-text
ratification or an administrator grant. `agreements.py` records it in
`AgreementMemberConsent`, writes balancing `MemberAlignmentEvent` ledger rows,
and relies on the central evaluator in `services/agreement_consent.py` for all
participation gates. Reuse that evaluator for ecosystem membership, domain
membership, and collaboration actions; do not reimplement a local shortcut.

New agreements follow the mandatory ACT sequence `draft → advice → consent →
test → active`. Status changes are ceremony records, and activation requires
both complete required consent and test evidence. Agreement policy and consent
must only be changed through the agreement endpoints so history and gates stay
in sync.

## ACT gate engine and gate inheritance

`services/act_gates.py` owns the ACT gates for proposals AND agreements. Each
record's `act_policy` declares minimum advice rounds, consent
requirement/quorum, and test cases; the engine auto-advances status when the
conditions are met and mints the decision artifact at completion
(`artifact_type` "proposal" or "commitment" with member participants).
A proposal with NULL `act_policy` inherits gates from its
`governing_agreement_id` (same-ecosystem agreement, validated on
create/update); explicit-null in PUT clears the declaration or the link.
Detail payloads carry `gates` (with `policy_source`), effective `act_policy`,
stored `own_act_policy`, and a `governing_agreement` brief — never recompute
any of this in a view. Agreement advice rounds and test evidence are recorded
via `POST /agreements/:id/ceremonies` (`outcome` "round"/"evidence"); manual
forward transitions that skip unmet gates are rejected 409 with the gates
payload.
